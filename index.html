			<h2>Synopsis</h2>
			<p padding-left: 3em;>We are trying to bridge that gap between online and in person classes. One common problem 
				with the online/hybrid classes is the lack of the effactive use of a whiteboard. 
				Normally, in-person class involves a whiteboard next to the notes projected on the 
				screen. Now, however, in order accomodate in person students and virtual students at 
				the same time, professors must share their screen virtually and project the screen in 
				person. Because there are virtual students, this takes away being able to draw, explain, 
				or elaborate using a whiteboard. This forces teachers to try to write using the trackpad 
				of their computer or using a stylus with a bad angle, resulting in annotations that are 
				less helpful than those on the whiteboard. Our research looks to develop a way for professors 
				to comfortably use a whiteboard in a way that it useful to both in person students and online 
				students. </p>
